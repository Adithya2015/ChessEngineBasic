Hi, I'm Adithya, and this is my first chess engine! Why am I doing this? - Just for fun! and to learn what it is like to work on a C++ project
The name of the chess engine is "Nature", and currently it plays poorly. I am yet to implement the search stage, so no wonder.
However, it is capable of playing complete chess, see if you can beat it!
